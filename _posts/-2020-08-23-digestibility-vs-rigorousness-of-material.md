write something about the inversed correlation between digestibility and rigurousness of material, and where in the graph each of the conventional medium used for conveying ideas are at. also write about when to pick which medium, depending on the avaliable time, how well you want to learn the material, and what you want to do with what you learned.


- the more rigorous the material is, the less accessible it is to people
- it is often hard to decide what kind of material to reference when you're trying to learn something new
