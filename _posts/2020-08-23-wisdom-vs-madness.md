"Wisdom of the crowd" is an effect which states that the average of a large enough sample size ($$n \rightarrow \infty$$) of answers towards a question such as "the population of the United States" will yield a guess that is very close to the correct answer. This is because the inaccuracies (noise) of each individual's answers is cancelled out after being averaged across other people's answers. This is typically only achievable when almost all participants are acting in good faith.

"Madness of the crowd" is a syndrome that occurs when a large group of ill-informed and/or impressionable public, influenced by a minor faction of individuals acting on bad faith. The combination of such two groups typically kickstarts a lynch mod mentality on individual(s) by condemning their actions or opinions from some arbitrarily defined moral high ground, usually self-contradictory and dogmatic in some ways.

It is important to see that this binary outcome can be applied to almost any question or opinion. Furthermore, the key issue is the public's lack of ability to differentiate which of the two is happening at any instance. Thus, an issue that could be resolved using the wisdom of the crowd can mutate and metastasise into madness of the crowd.

We must also assume that the majority of the public intend to act in good faith. Otherwise, any discussions in attempting to equip ourselves with tools to avoid conversations devolving into madness is moot.

Under that assumption, I submit to you a draft of a potential solution to avoid madness: understand the motives of the person behind the question and the reaction from the audience.

To avoid participating unwittingly in driving a conversation towards madness, one must attempt to identify what factors in the formulation of a question/opinion lead to each of the two outcomes:

- timing of the question (when to ask one)
- phrasing of the question
- where this question is asked (on what platform)
- who is asking this question

These factors are also usually considered by an audience in order to understand the motive of person(s) that asked the question, and to contextualize the question itself.
