first, a few definitions on the usage of phrases, imposed by me, to clarify the context of this commentary:
- pseudo: fake, in the guise of, pretending
- liberalism: "a political and moral philosophy based on liberty, consent of the governed and equality before the law"[^1]

[^1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism>


- law of highly improbable as a substitute for promise of equal opportunity
