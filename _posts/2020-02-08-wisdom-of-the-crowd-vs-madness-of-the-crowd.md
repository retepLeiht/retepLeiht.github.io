- wisdom of the crowd states that the average of a large enough sample size ($n \rightarrow \infty$) of answers towards a simple question such as "the population size of Hong Kong" will yield a guess that is very close to the correct answer.

- madness of the crowd is a syndrome that occurs when a large group of ill-informed public, influenced by a minority faction of individuals acting on bad faith. the combination of these two groups typically kickstarts a the lynch mod mentality on individual(s) (frequently high profile) by condemning their actions from some arbitrarily defined moral high ground, usually self-contradictory and dogmatic in some ways.

- the key issue here is the public's lack of ability to differentiate which of the two is happening in any instance. more importantly, an issue that could be resolved using the wisdom of the crowd can metastasize and mutant into the madness of the crowd
